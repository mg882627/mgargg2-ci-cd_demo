| Time | Theatre | Session | Smart question to ask |
|---|---|---|---|
| 09:15–10:00 | Y‑Axis Keynote Theatre | The Road to Hell Is Paved with Agents: Navigating the Perils and Promise of the Agentic Enterprise [11] | What specific oversight, rollback, and audit controls are required before agentic systems can take autonomous actions in production without human‑in‑the‑loop escalation paths? [11] |
| 10:00–10:30 | Y‑Axis Keynote Theatre | Getting Real About Artificial Intelligence Value [11] | Which leading indicators (for example, adoption, time‑to‑insight, unit‑cost‑to‑serve) best predict Generative Artificial Intelligence return on investment in the first 90 days—before revenue impact shows on the profit and loss statement? [11] |
| 10:40–11:10 | Data Engineering Theatre | What Happens When You Ask an Artificial Intelligence Agent to Refresh Your Data? [11] | How do least‑privilege credentials, data contracts, and prompt‑safety guardrails prevent agent‑triggered overreach across connectors and downstream jobs? [11] |
| 11:20–11:50 | Data and Artificial Intelligence Strategy Theatre | How Runna Supercharged Data in Just 6 Months with Snowflake [11] | What spend‑versus‑speed trade‑offs and governance gates made the cut in the first 6 months, and which would be changed if starting again? [11] |
| 12:00–12:30 | Data Engineering Theatre | Declarative Large Language Model Engineering with DSPy and Dagster [11] | What evaluation metrics and promotion gates are used to advance a Large Language Model pipeline from experiment to production directed acyclic graphs without increasing mean time to repair or incident rates? [11] |
| 12:40–13:10 | Data Architecture Modernisation Theatre | From Warehouse to Lakehouse: Our Journey to a Scalable, Decentralised Data Platform [11] | Which data product boundaries and contracts were most contentious during decentralisation, and how were ownership, service‑level agreements, and cost accountability resolved? [11] |
| 14:00–14:30 | Data Architecture Modernisation Theatre | Streaming with Apache Iceberg: From Zero to Hero [11] | What compaction, retention, and schema evolution patterns keep streaming‑to‑Apache Iceberg stable and query‑efficient as volumes and concurrency rise? [11] |
| 14:40–15:10 | Data Operations and Observability Theatre | Scaling Observability at Telecom Speed: Virgin Media O2’s Zero‑Downtime Data Journey [11] | Which service‑level objectives, error budgets, and lineage‑driven runbook changes most reduced data downtime, and how is reliability improvement measured quarter‑over‑quarter? [11] |
| 15:20–15:50 | Data Architecture Modernisation Theatre | Accelerating Data Science with NVIDIA Rapid Analytics and Processing for Interactive Data Science (RAPIDS) [11] | Which workload classes delivered at least ten‑times cost‑performance gains, and what developer enablement or pipeline refactors were required to realise them? [11] |

Notes:
- Artificial Intelligence (AI), Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Large Language Model (LLM), Rapid Analytics and Processing for Interactive Data Science (RAPIDS), service‑level agreement (SLA), service‑level objective (SLO), mean time to repair (MTTR), and return on investment (ROI) have all been expanded above where relevant. [11]
- If a different emphasis is preferred (for example, governance or analytics), strong alternates in the same windows include Data and Artificial Intelligence Observability at 10:40 (X‑Axis Keynote Theatre) and leadership/agentic strategy blocks around 14:40. [11]
