- Adjust session specifics onsite/app as speaker and topic details become visible [9][11].
- Arrive early for main theatres (Data Engineering, DataOps, Architecture) to anchor your schedule [10].
- Swap in VIP Theatre for private leadership/Q&A if eligible during any slot except networking breaks [9][11].

This schedule ensures maximum learning, networking value, and platform relevance in every session for a Head of Data Engineering [5].
